        <p><b>Monday 16 Oct 2023</b>
            <hr color="black">
        <p class="story-so-far"> Under the muted light of the early morning, our intrepid adventurers began a new day.
            The peaceful serenity of dawn was broken only by the faint sounds of snoring from within their campsite. It
            was a moment of respite in a land shrouded in darkness..</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Aurea shared her unsettling discovery, recounting how she had overheard two ravens.
            These enigmatic birds had appeared surprised by the presence of the adventurers, leaving an ominous question
            mark hanging in the air.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Turning left onto a cobblestone path with Irena at its center, the group departed from
            the dirt trail. Their journey took a grim turn as they stumbled upon a decaying corpse of a peasant,
            evidence of a gruesome and mysterious demise. It bore marks of animal bites and a massive, axe-like wound
            under the arm.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Upon reaching a crossroads, a single gallows brought back haunting memories for one of
            the travelers. They chose to head southwest, descending deeper into the ominous unknown.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Midday brought with it a chilling howl, echoing from the direction they were heading. As
            they ventured further into the woods, the darkness seemed to engulf them, the very air growing thicker and
            more foreboding.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">After half an hour of ascending from the valley, a barely discernible, overgrown path to
            the right caught their attention. It was a path seemingly forgotten by time, leading them more northward. As
            their leader ventured down the path, he felt a creeping sensation, as if eyes were watching. A haunting
            howl confirmed her unease.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Fjall, with his keen senses, spotted two white, spectral eyes about 60 feet away. He
            attempted to intimidate the watcher with an eldritch display, but the eyes remained, an eerie outline of a
            figure emerging. In a raspy voice, it inquired, "Friend or foe?" Fjall, hoping to avoid conflict, declared
            "friend," prompting the eyes to vanish, the figure retreating behind a tree.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">With a newfound sense of urgency, the group hurried away from this enigmatic presence
            and resumed their journey, the path sometimes vanishing only to be found again.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Emerging from the thick woods, they returned to a well-defined path, confronted with the
            choice to turn left or right. The discovery of fresh footprints led them to retrace their steps, ultimately
            resuming their journey and turning right. Oddly, they noticed what appeared to be their own footprints that
            seemed to lead away from, back
            to, and away from their path.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">As they ventured forward, they encountered a heavily armoured figure, their armour
            rusted
            and falling apart. The stranger bore the stench of decay and dragged a weapon in one hand while clutching a
            severed wolf's head in the other. Fjall mimicked the mysterious voice from their earlier encounter, and the
            figure responded with a declaration: "If I was foe, you would be dead." Turning towards them, the same
            spectral eyes from before materialised. The severed wolf head was tossed in their direction, and the figure
            advanced.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">In a radiant display, Freyina revealed her celestial heritage to the half-dead figure.
            They continued their journey toward Valakye, their destination in sight. Along the way, they encountered a
            stone bridge covered in moss, stretching over a chasm and adorned with ominous gargoyles. In the distance,
            smoke from a fire could be seen, and they realized they had taken a long and circuitous route. Crossing the
            bridge, they pressed on.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">A sign at a crossroads pointed northwest to Valakye, but the unnerving presence of a
            dozen ravens ahead raised questions about the barren wildlife they had encountered thus far. Another
            crossroads offered a left turn with a partially obscured sign, that suggested at a mill possibaly owned by
            the Durst family. Urged by Irena, they hastened their pace.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Suddenly, four wolves emerged from the forest and the battle unfolded in a chaotic
            whirlwind as Irena charged into battle with a war cry that sent shiver down the spines of all who heard it,
            in one swift motion, her blade sliced through the air, cleaving through the nearest wolf's fur and flesh as
            if it was nothing, the wolf's lifeless form crumpled to the ground, but the battle was far from over. Behind
            the group, a monstrous wolf, standing on its hind legs, towered at an intimidating six feet. It charged with
            a speed and ferocity that sent tremors through the earth beneath its paws and the adventurers found
            themselves locked in combat against both wolves and a fearsome werewolf that had emerged from behind the
            group.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far"></p>Irena's fury knew no bounds, and her blade struck once more. Another wolf fell
        beneath her relentless
        assault, its yelps and struggles abruptly silenced. Fjall, ever the resourceful spellcaster, wove a powerful
        enchantment into the air. With a wave of his hand, two of the wolves were ensnared by a deep, dreamless
        sleep. Their bodies collapsed, providing a brief respite from the chaos.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">After a short a vicious battle the werewolf retreated, bleeding and battered, to the tree
            line where a pack of
            wolves waited to attack the adventurers. As it reached the edge of the forest, it turned, its eyes blazing
            with an eerie light. In a voice laced with malevolence, it declared, "Stradh sends his regards," before
            vanishing into the darkness of the woods.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far"> With a bloodthirsty growl, the remaining wolves, undeterred by their leader's retreat,
            advanced on the
            adventurers. Their teeth gnashed, and their claws tore through the air as they lunged forward in a frenzied
            attack.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far"> Amidst the tumultuous battle, Freyina lay on the ground, her life force fading. Her
            breath came in ragged
            gasps, her strength waning. As the wolves closed in, their hot, fetid breath mingling with the scent of
            blood, the fate of the fallen adventurer hung in the balance.</p>
        <p class="story-so-far">Amid the chaos, the werewolf retreated, promising Stradh's regards, and wolves closed
            in, their sharp teeth bared in a deadly assault. The outcome hung in the balance, the adventurers standing
            on the precipice of victory or annihilation.</p>
