        <p><b>Monday 25 Sep 2023</b>
            <hr color="black">
        <p class="story-so-far"> In the dimly lit depths of a decrepit house that stood as a somber sentinel to an age
            long
            past, our group of
            brave adventurers ventured forth. The narrow stone staircase, seemed to descend into the very heart of
            darkness
            itself, with Peradox leading the way, their torch casting eerie shadows that danced menacingly on the aged
            walls.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">As they ventured deeper into the mansion, they couldn't help but hear the incessant
            whispers
            that seemed to
            emanate from all around them. The words, if one dared to focus, were chilling—death, king, sacrifice—but the
            whispers were elusive, as though they slipped through the cracks of sanity.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Moving further down the stone corridors, barely wider than an average humans shoulder
            width,
            they encountered
            two alcoves, each adorned with doors bearing names. The adventurers' curiosity led them to open the door
            marked
            "Rosa Valda Durst," revealing a crypt with a stone coffin. Strangely, the coffin was empty. Fjall, driven by
            curiosity, peered inside, only to find emptiness staring back. The names on these doors matched those of the
            children's ghosts that haunted the upper floors—a grim realisation.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Pressing on, they entered a room that had once been use as some kind of dining hall but
            had
            long fallen into
            disuse. In one alcove, Fjall, touching things he shouldn’t, inadvertently disturbed something that triggered
            a
            ferocious battle—a green snake-like creature that Aurea recognised as a Grick. Its beak-like maw latched
            onto
            Fjall's wrist, while its tentacles sought to ensnare the others. In a blaze of fiery magic, Ezara dispatched
            the
            creature, saving her companions.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">As they delved deeper, the whispers transformed, becoming deeper and more rhythmic,
            evolving
            into a haunting
            chant. This was the source, they knew. Entering a large chamber with thirteen alcoves, they found strange
            items
            displayed on plinths. A yellow-bound hand, a bone knife, a dagger with a rat's skull pommel, an eye-like
            orb,
            and more. A deep voice resonated, proclaiming, "He is the ancient, he is the land."</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Fjall, concealing his true intentions, pocketed the dagger with the rat's head pommel.
            Further exploration
            unveiled a grim prison, complete with shackles and chains. One set held a skeletal figure in a tattered
            black
            robe, still bound and lifeless.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">In their relentless pursuit, they uncovered a concealed lever that revealed a chamber
            with a
            murky pool and an
            eerie altar. A wheel controlled a portcullis, but it was only when Fjall stepped upon the top of the dias
            that
            they triggered a spectral manifestation—a group of black-cloaked beings with featureless faces. They chanted
            ominously, "One must die." In the end, it was the entity born from the green slime and constructed from the
            rubble of a collapsed wall that threatened them. Aurea and Ezara retreated, and the siblings, Fjall and
            Freyina
            narrowly escaped through the portcullis being opened by Peradox, leaving the cursed being behind. It was not
            an
            easy escape as all the doors had been replaced by swinging scythe's which spared none as the party tried to
            escape, but at the last hurdle to freedom Peradox took a mortal blow and was left close to death on the
            ground
            just outside this cursed house, but with the healing touch of Aurea was he saved from the brink of death…
            this
            time.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Emerging back from the twisted reality of the house to the village, they heard weeping
            somewhere in the
            distance. Their journey led them to Bildrath's Mercantile, the only building illuminated in the otherwise
            darkened village. Nearby, the Blood on the Vine Tavern beckoned, its sign defaced and altered, reflecting
            the
            grim change that had befallen the land.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Within, they encountered three women whose vibrant attire had faded, and a lone man
            named
            Ismark. He pleaded for
            their help, revealing a tale of vampiric terror and his sister Irena's desperate need for protection. The
            vampyr
            lord ruling this land hunted her, and the once-grand mansion had become a desolate ruin. Ismark allowed them
            to
            use some spare rooms and food to help them rest and recuperate and decide if they would help escort his
            sister
            to the next village, Valakai.</p>

        <p class="story-so-far">Their journey into the mists of darkness had only just begun, and the adventurers now
            faced
            a choice—to heed the
            call of this desperate plea for help or to succumb to the ever-encroaching darkness that threatened to
            swallow
            them whole.</p>
